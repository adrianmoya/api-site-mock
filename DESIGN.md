DESIGN ELEMENTS
===============

The design elements are based on twitter bootstrap
(http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), for quick general layout that is
a bit more concise than blueprint. (It also happens to be what the horizon
project is using for design)

I have been pretty sparing with javascript, but one of the elements of the
site is hiding/showing the details of each call so that a single large page
acts as both an index and discoverable detail in one shot. The javascript
is using straight jQuery.
